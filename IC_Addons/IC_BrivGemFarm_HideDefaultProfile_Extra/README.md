# Briv Gem Farm - Hide Default Profile

This is just a very simple addon that will hide the `Default` profile from the drop down list on the Briv Gem Farm tab (if it's not the only one).

The reason is simply because if you press arrow keys while the Briv Gem Farm tab is selected - you can swap profiles - and if your gem farm is running when that happens... bad times.

> [!NOTE]
> *If you save or delete a profile - the Default profile will return. You would need to reload script hub to have this addon remove it again. (I will try to find a solution to this when I get a round tuit.)*
